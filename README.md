# WeaponAttachmentTrainer
Basic GTAV trainer based off NativeTrainer by Alexander Blade http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/

This mod allows you to change your selected weapons attachments on the fly. 
It also comes with a hotkey that will toggle your weapons silencer on and off. Sick of your silenced pistol and you just want to blast on fools on the streets all loud-like? Hit 'O' and remove that bitch. That's keyboard 'O' as in "OH MY GOD I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO AMMUNATION ANYMORE TO CHANGE ATTACHMENTS ON MY GUNS".

## Installation
Copy WeaponAttachmentTrainer.asi and WeaponAttachmentTrainer.ini to whatever folder your GTAV.EXE resides in.

## Usage
Press 'F5' in game to toggle the trainer menu. 'O' toggles silencer.

WeaponAttachmentTrainer.ini has all that you need to change the hotkeys.

The .ini file also lets your silencer toggle setting persist across game sessions.

## Compiling
It probably requires some MSVC++ runtime library something or other to run. I don't know. If you can run NativeTrainer fine, you should be able to run this.

It'll probably compile on your rig with VS 2013. Probably. Everything needed to compile should be included. No need to download the Script Hook V SDK.
